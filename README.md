# UIUX Project: Colorfill

A coloring application. The core feature of Colorfill allows user to have refined selection of color through optional secondary spectrum generated based on the initial choice of color. When color is chosen from the outer color spectrum, the inner circle gets filled with gradation generated based on the initial selection. If the user wants to use darker version of the initial color selection, any part of the second circle can be selected for color choice.
  
Several different approachs to prototyping and designing principles, such as hierarchical task analysis and observational study, were used in this project to understand different approaches we can take as UI/UX developers.
   
   
## Cycle I: Investigation and Ideation

### Initial Hierarchical Task Analysis

Initial hierarchical task analysis was made to map out the conventional user flow of coloring process. The analysis was than applied to design six prototypes for coloring application.


### Summary of Obeservational Study
    Our observational study of normal coloring interaction were performed by our two users who both regularly enjoy coloring books but had their first time using coloring apps. In the process, we found out the user wants to pick out color very carefully and be not interfered when the coloring process happens. Following this insightful contribution, we ideated our own coloring application that can compete against actual sketchbook and coloring pencils.

### Protocol Summary
    After introducing ourselves and briefly getting to know our users, we explained them about our project. W​ithout any kind of regulation, ​we had our users ​feel free to choose any image they would like to color in any way they want to. We a​sked them to try exploring how to use the app them​selves and comment out loud on any kind of thoughts they come up with.

#### Themes
  **Synethesis Theme**
  * Let users know about the zoom in feature: Both users found themselves desperate at attempting to color somall detailed parts until they realized they could zoom in.
  * Confusing icons: the icons in the application seemed to be unclear. Users either made mistakes or were not aware of what exactly some icons represented.
