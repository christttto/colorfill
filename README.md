# UIUX Project: Colorfill
<!--finished product design-->
![Screenshot](Colorfill.png)
  
The core feature of Colorfill allows user to have refined selection of color through optional secondary spectrum generated based on the initial choice of color. When color is chosen from the outer color spectrum, the inner circle gets filled with gradation generated based on the initial selection. If the user wants to use darker version of the initial color selection, any part of the second circle can be selected for color choice.


   
   
## Cycle I: Investigation and Ideation

### Summary of Obeservational Study
  Our observational study of normal coloring interaction were performed by our two users who both regularly enjoy coloring books but had their first time using coloring apps. In the process, we found out the user wants to pick out color very carefully and be not interfered when the coloring process happens. Following this insightful contribution, we ideated our own coloring application that can compete against actual sketchbook and coloring pencils.
### Protocol Summary
  After introducing ourselves and briefly getting to know our users, we explained them about our project. W​ithout any kind of regulation, ​we had our users ​feel free to choose any image they would like to color in any way they want to. We a​sked them to try exploring how to use the app them​selves and comment out loud on any kind of thoughts they come up with.
### Themes
  **Synethesis Theme**
  * Let users know about the zoom in feature: Both users found themselves desperate at attempting to color somall detailed parts until they realized they could zoom in.
  * Confusing icons: the icons in the application seemed to be unclear. Users either made mistakes or were not aware of what exactly some icons represented.


### Investigation: Mood Board
  
The user “storm chaser” moves from different locations very fast. The storm chaser can be best described as extreme. The mood board consists of extreme contrast or action with little complication.

### Theme
  1. **Saturation**  
  The mood board focuses mostly on prime colors: blue and red, making the overall board feel saturated. Eliminating less vivid color from the board allowed it to be very extreme with color choice. The biggest reasoning behind was to create vivid and clear implication as how the user should feel.

  2. **Isolation**  
  While the mood board is filled with strong red and blue, the rest is mostly filled with black, or the absence of color. The intention behind these selections of images was to keep the focus of the user on the information shown by eliminating unnecessary components, keeping the application simple.

  3. **Conflict**  
  The conflict of two main colors red and blue carry certain expectation of describing something hot and cold. The shown two conflicting colors on mood board to the user will guide user to assume the information will have to do with temperature.  
  At the middle of the mood board, two prime color merges and shows violet and the overall board includes hint of white and violet to create sense of gradation between two conflicting colors.


### Ideation: Interaction Sketches  
<!--six different ui design-->

| **1.Geo-weather Forecast** | **2. Mix-Match Forecast** |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| <div align="center"><img src="Initial-Interaction-Sketches-Geo-Weather-Forecast.png" width=50%></div> |  <div align="center"><img src="Initial-Interaction-Sketches-Mix-Match_forecast.png" width=50%></div> |
| This application incorporates geographic representation of locations the user would be interested to visualize. The meter at the bottom represents time period you want to search, and the labels for each location will show the weather at that time. | Like any conventional weather application, this application can represent weather for each day. However, the user can swipe each date to display wanted locations for that date.                                                                           |
| **3. Weather Calendar**    | **4. Excelling Weather**  |
| <div align="center"><img src="Initial-Interaction-Sketches-Weather-Calendar.png" width=50%></div> |  <div align="center"><img src="Initial-Interaction-Sketches-Excelling-Weather.png" width=50%></div> |
| This application can show calendar filled with minimal weather information. For each day, you can choose which location’s weather you want to display. | Spreadsheet-like display of simple weather for each location, for each day. User can select which day and location to highlight to mark which place will have desired weather. |
| **5. Weather Where** | **6. Weather Calendar** |
| <div align="center"><img src="Initial-Interaction-Sketches-Weather-Where.png" width=50%></div> |  <div align="center"><img src="Initial-Interaction-Sketches-Weather-Calendar2.png" width=50%></div> |
| The upper half of the display can be scrolled to show consecutive days, and for each day the user can choose which location to show. Right now, 6/13 is selected and user is in process to choose which location to display. | The user can choose specific day on calendar. When chosen, list of considered location will pop out for user to decide which location’s weather will be shown on the calendar for that day. |

## Cycle II: Low-fidelity Prototype  

### Wireframe  
A wireframe was drawn before high-fidelity implementation to clear the specification project needed. Four key screens of the application was prototyped and detailed information or implementation needs were designed.  
<div align="center"><img src="cycleIIrefined.jpg" width=50%></div>

  1. Home page of the application with the map
  2. Page to search and add locations to the main page
  3. Detailed information focusing on one location of the listed locations
  4. Notifation page of weather change

### Peer Critique Summary  
* Peer critique on refined interaction sketch overall points out positive aspect of time bar feature described on Geo-weather application, as it will provide storm chasing user with quick check of weather in all the locations depending on time change. However, the application still needs to further describe how locations can be edited. Good feature to add to the time bar would be a way to reset the bar to be at current time, after maneuvering around.  
* Feature like adding location seemed to take up too much space, which leads to interfering of core information display. Therefore, features that are less critical will be minimized and simplified to stay direct and intuitive. Improvement on the time bar is needed, as the time and hour needs to be more specific, or better aligned with the weather information’s time resolution.  
* Location specific information shown from my different application Mix-match Forecast can be used with Geo-weather to better display detailed weather information on specific location when the user needs. New screen will allow location specific information to be better displayed, providing what user will be looking for.
